            <b>Chatroom Server/Client</b><br>
            This program is written in C++. It uses multithreading and semaphores to implement a chatroom and was created to get a better understanding of the topics being covered in my Computer Systems Design class.<br>

            <b>Soccer Standings Discord Bot</b><br>
            This program is written in Python and it creates a Discord Bot that allows you to view the standings of 14 major soccer leagues and seasons 2013-present. This was done by webscraping the ESPN website using the BeautifulSoup4 library.<br>
